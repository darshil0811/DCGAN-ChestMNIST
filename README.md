# 🧠 DCGAN on ChestMNIST – Synthetic Medical Image Generation

This project implements a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** to generate synthetic chest X-ray images using the **ChestMNIST** dataset. The objective is to explore the power of GANs in medical imaging, specifically for data augmentation, education, and enhancing model robustness in low-data scenarios.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** [ChestMNIST](https://medmnist.com/)
- **Model:** DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow & PyTorch
- **Objective:** Train a generator to produce realistic chest X-ray images, and a discriminator to differentiate between real and synthetic samples.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.12+
- TensorFlow 2.17
- PyTorch 2.6
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- MedMNIST API
- imageio (for GIF creation)

## 🧠 How GAN Works (Cool Analogy: 🎭 Forger vs Detective)

Imagine a battle between:
- 🧑‍🎨 A **forger** (Generator) trying to create fake paintings.
- 🕵️‍♂️ A **detective** (Discriminator) trying to catch the fakes.

As they compete:
- The **forger** gets better at mimicking real paintings.
- The **detective** gets sharper at spotting fakes.

Eventually, the forgeries become indistinguishable from real ones — and that’s when the GAN wins.

---

## 🧪 Workflow Summary

1. **Load & preprocess ChestMNIST dataset**
2. **Define the Generator & Discriminator models**
3. **Train adversarially for N epochs**
4. **Generate & save synthetic images**
5. **Compare real vs synthetic outputs**
6. **Export results as visual grids and GIFs**

---

## 📊 Results

- Generator successfully learned chest X-ray patterns over epochs
- Visual comparison clearly distinguishes improvement
- Final output includes:
  - **“Reel vs Real”** side-by-side collage
  - Epoch-wise synthetic image progression
  - Animated training GIF
